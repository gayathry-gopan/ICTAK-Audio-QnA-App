# ICTAK-Audio-QnA-App
An interactive, conversational (audio) Q&amp;A application designed to provide information about the courses, fees, and duration offered by the ICT Academy of Kerala. This project showcases the use of conversational AI for a practical, real-world application.
## Features
Voice-to-Text & Text-to-Speech: Enables natural, two-way audio conversation.

Conversational AI: Utilizes a powerful AI model to understand user queries and provide relevant information.

## Technologies Used:
   ### Front-end:
 HTML, CSS , JavaScript

### APIs:

Google Gemini API (for text generation and audio)

Web Speech API (for Speech Recognition)

## How to Run the App
To run this application, simply open the **audio_qa_app.html** file in your web browser. The app is a single-file web application, so no complex setup or server is required.

**Note:** The application requires access to the microphone for audio input. Please grant the necessary permissions when prompted by your browser.
## Prompt Engineering
This application was developed using advanced prompt engineering techniques to guide the AI model's responses. The prompt directs the model to act as a knowledgeable guide specifically for ICTAK, ensuring the answers are accurate, relevant, and focused on the provided topics (courses, fees, duration, etc.). This approach minimizes irrelevant information and maintains a consistent, helpful persona.
